# Computer Vision

Computer Vision practice using OpenCV library for python.

## Image Processing Intro

First Practice with OpenCV and image processing. There are 5 different practices:

1. Basic Image Thresholding
2. Denoising - Intro to Filters
3. Sobel Edge Detection
4. Canny Edge Detection
5. Harris Corner Detection

Google Colab is used to write the Jupyter Notebooks, however you can run it locally as well.

The images are assumed to be in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, if you want to run it locally, please remember to copy the images and the notebook into the same directory. Since I used Google Colab, it was easier for me to do this by uploading the images into the content directory of the Google Colab VM.

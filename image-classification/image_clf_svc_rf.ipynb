Comparing Results of SVC and RF\n","\n","Looking at the accuracies of SVC and RF, we can say that SVC is more accurate when it comes to classification, after the hyperparameters are finely tuned. Before fine-tuning the hyperparameters, RF is better at classification.\n","\n","Also, during my executions, I noticed that SVC usually gets the same accuracy for the same hyperparameters at each run while the accuracy of RF can change for the same hyperparamaters. This is an observation made before using the random_state hyperparameter.\n","\n","Comparing the performance of the classifier with respect to the changes in random_state, SVC is more robust and stable. It has the same accuracy for different random state values. On the other hand, RF is not that robust when it comes to the changes in the random state. As we can see from the accuracies, SVC produces the same accuracy for different random state values while RF has a range of accuracy from 46.67% to 52.2%.\n"]}]}
